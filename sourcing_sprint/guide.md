## Getting Started

Thank you for participating in the BigScience Data Sourcing hackathon! Please use this guide as you submit information about potential data sources for the BigScience dataset using the form.

## Loading the Form

To load the form #TODO

## Filling Out the Form

To get started, please add your name, add your email (optional), and select the type of resource you would like to add in the left-hand column. Then proceed to filling out the form. 

For the purposes of this work, we're organizing data sources into three categories: primary source, processed dataset, and partner organization.

### Adding a Primary Source
What's a primary source? 4-5 ex #TODO

A primary source is a single source of language data (text or speech), such as a newspaper, radio, website, book collection, etc. You will be asked to fill in information about the availability of the source, its properties including availability and presence of personal information, its owners or producers, and the format of the language data.

#### Name, ID, Homepage, Description

First, provide a descriptive name for the resource. This should be a human-readable name such as e.g. **Le Monde newspaper**. 

In the next box provide a short `camel_case` unique identifier for the resource, for example `le_monde_primary`.

If available, provide a link to the home page for the resource e.g. https://www.lemonde.fr/.

Provide a short description of the resource, in a few words to a few sentences. The description will be used to index and navigate the catalogue. 

#### Languages and Locations

Please add all of the languages that are covered by the resource. For each additional language, click the 'Add Language' checkbox and select the language from the dropdown menu. This is the higher-level classification of the languages that currently have working groups in the BigScience project, so selecting the Indic and Niger-Congo languages will open a new selection box for the specific language. 

For the location of the resource, select the country where the resource or organization itself located or hosted. E.g.: where is the **website hosted**, what is the physical **location of the library**, etc.?

Additionally, please select all of the countries where the data creators represented in the source are from. E.g.: where are the **people who write on the website** hosted?

### Adding a Processed Dataset
What kind of processed datasets can you add? Must have more than single-sentence examples, 2-3 examples

a processed NLP dataset containing language data that can be used for language modeling (most items should be at least a few sentences long).
You will be asked to fill in information about the dataset object itself as well as the primary sources it was derived from
(e.g. Wikipedia, or news sites for most summarization datasets).
